        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I have been a proffessional software developer for more 15 years, as an individual contributer
          as well as a team leader. In this page, I would like to share some of my experiences and understandings
          and understandings about SW development and about life.

          <h3>Trail Running</h3>
          <p>There is nothing as fulfilling as a good trail run. Although at late I have not been running as much as I would like,
            whenever I pickup the old snikkers and venture out Running as much as Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, mauris sed consectetuer. Etiam et eu, bibendum interdum, lacus quis mauris. Curabitur wisi, quisque vel eu, rutrum nam.</p>

          <h3>Offroading</h3>
          <p>With the help of Mani, our 2009 Pajero BK, me and my family try to get out to the trails as often as twice a month.
            The views, the challange and camping out, make it a tremendoues experience for the whole family.
